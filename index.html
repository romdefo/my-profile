			<h1>A big Hello to the World</h1>
			<img src="images/photo bali.jpg" alt="Romain Defouilhoux picture" class="img-circle">
			<p>Allow me to introduce myself to you all, wanderers of the virtual world. I am <b>Romain Defouilhoux</b> , a 22 year old French boy whose profile page you just have landed on for no reason at all. I currently am finalizing my Master's in Management at HEC Paris. I'm a nature lover ; above all else, apes and monkeys fascinate me. I'm a fan of video games and new tech, which got me passionate about science-fiction, be it on pages or on screen. I also happen to worship Chaikovsky's music.</p>

			<h2>Why I chose</h2>

			<p>I dare say, why not? After high school, I dared not even think about whatever plans the future had in store for me. All I wanted was to be happy. I took a two-year preparatory course and ended up at HEC. The school, being very prestigious, is said to be a door-opener. I was lost and a door-opener was exactly what I needed. I'm still looking for a future, by the way.</p>

			<h2>My life is pure science-fiction</h2>
			<p>I believe when I first finished reading the third book of <b>Isaac Asimov's <i>Foundation</i> series</b>, my eyes opened so wide they almost fell out of their sockets. I was blown away. If ever there were an author you wished for me to recommend, I would not dare hesitate: Isaac is and always will be the one.</p>

			</a> 
			<p>Nestled in the heart of South East Asia, Borneo is home to fascinating species now facing extinction, among which <a href="https://www.balisafarimarinepark.com/proboscis-monkey/" target="blank">Proboscis monkeys</a> and the mighty <a href="https://www.orangutan.com" target="blank">orangutans</a>. In the Malaysian and Indonesian languages, "orang hutan" means <b>"person of the forest"</b>. Their gaze is just as deep as that of a human being. I often hear they look like us but considering how evolution works, it is proper to say <i>we</i> look like them.</p>
